# Lab 5 â€“ Signal Convolution

This repository contains Python scripts and visualizations for understanding discrete-time signal convolution.  
The implementations include step-by-step convolution between various signals such as sinusoids, pulses, and square waves.

## Contents
- Convolution of a sinusoidal signal with a pulse
- Convolution of a square wave with a pulse
- Convolution between sinusoidal signals

## Purpose
These scripts were developed as part of a final thesis project on Digital Radar Signal Processing.  
They demonstrate how signal convolution works in discrete time, enabling better understanding of fundamental DSP operations using simple Python code and visual output.

## Files

- `.py` files: contain the code for signal processing functions  

These resources help build a deeper understanding of how metric functions and signal operations apply to real-world digital signal processing scenarios.
